# Oarstack compositions for 2022

Music inspired by slow motion rowing.  Yes, it does sound weird when you say it.

Compositions Â© Andy Southgate 2020-2022.

Much of the heavy liftng is handled by the sample libraries.  Albion Tundra from [Spitfire Audio](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/), with some Spitfire Solo Strings thrown in.  I just press the buttons.
